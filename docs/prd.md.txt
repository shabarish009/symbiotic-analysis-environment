To: Project Lead

Dear Team,

This email serves as a complete, portable summary and final handoff of our intensive planning session for the "Symbiotic Analysis Environment" project. We have successfully completed the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Phase 1: The Core Engine & The Killer App.

The following content represents the full context of our work, including all finalized sections of the PRD, a summary of your pending requests for future phases, and the immediate next steps for the development team.
Finalized Product Requirements Document (PRD) v1.0
Section 1: Goals and Background Context

    Goals:

        Deliver the foundational XP Shell.

        Implement the core AI Core (Consensus Engine & Project Cortex).

        Launch a fully-featured SQL Analyst "killer app".

        Establish the project as a viable, local-first, open-source alternative.

    Background: The current data analysis landscape is fragmented and inefficient. This project creates a unified, free, open-source desktop application that acts as an active AI partner, empowering the "frustrated data artisan" in a private, local-first environment.

Section 2: Requirements

    Functional Requirements (FR):

        FR1: Authentic Windows XP styled GUI.

        FR2: Interactive desktop "canvas" for arranging tools.

        FR3: Dedicated SQL Analyst tool (connect, write, execute, manage queries).

        FR4: Consensus Engine uses multiple AI models for validated output.

        FR5: AI's reasoning process is visually exposed to the user.

        FR6: Project Cortex saves in-session context (e.g., corrected queries).

        FR7: Support for typed text commands.

        FR8 (Revised): A generic Reactive Dataflow Engine representing all components as interconnected "nodes".

    Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):

        NFR1: Local-first architecture.

        NFR2: Built with Tauri (Rust backend) and a web frontend.

        NFR3: AI Core is a separate, embedded Python process.

        NFR4: UI remains responsive during AI processing.

        NFR5: Must be Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS).

        NFR6: Zero mandatory cloud service costs.

        NFR7 (New): Core architecture must be designed for future extensibility.

    Explicitly Out of Scope for Phase 1:

        Excel & Flat File Analyst (Planned for Phase 2).

        Dashboard Creator (Planned for Phase 2).

        Full Guardrails System & Collaboration Framework (Planned for later phases).

Section 3: User Interface Design Goals

    Vision: A living, symbiotic environment that creates a "flow state".

    Paradigms: Direct Manipulation, Transparent AI, Text Commands.

    Accessibility: Target WCAG AA. Guiding Principle: Modern accessibility and usability standards will always take precedence over strict retro authenticity.

    Branding: A high-fidelity, authentic Windows XP aesthetic.

Section 4: Technical Assumptions and Constraints

    Architecture: Cross-platform desktop app using Tauri and an embedded Python process for the AI Core.

    Data: All data is stored and processed locally.

    Security: The advanced Guardrails System is out of scope for Phase 1. Users are responsible for their queries in their local environments.

    Integrations:

        Database Connectors: Initial support for PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and SQLite.

        Local LLMs: AI performance is dependent on user hardware.

    Constraints: Solo-developer, zero-dollar budget, strict adherence to the phased roadmap.

Section 5 & 6: High-Level Epics & User Stories

    Epic 1: The Core Application Shell & UX

        1.1: One-click installer for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

        1.2: Authentic Windows XP look and feel.

        1.3: Ability to open, close, move, and resize windows on the canvas.

        1.4: Application remembers window layout between sessions.

        1.5: UI elements (buttons, menus) conform to XP design.

        1.6: UI complies with WCAG AA accessibility standards.

    Epic 2: The Core AI Engine

        2.1: AI engine starts and runs seamlessly in the background.

        2.2: Consensus Engine uses multiple models to generate a trustworthy answer.

        2.3: User can see a simplified view of the AI's "thought process".

        2.4: AI remembers project context (schemas, query history).

        2.5: AI learns from user corrections during a session.

        2.6: AI engine runs entirely locally with open-source LLMs.

    Epic 3: The SQL Analyst Application

        3.1: Securely connect to various databases.

        3.2: SQL editor with syntax highlighting and line numbers.

        3.3: Execute query and see results in a sortable, filterable table.

        3.4: Schema explorer to view database tables and columns.

        3.5: AI generates draft SQL from a natural language goal.

        3.6: AI can explain, optimize, or check a user's SQL query.

        3.7: Output of one query can be used as input for another (Reactive Dataflow).

Section 7 & 8: Readiness & Next Steps

    The PRD is complete and ready for handoff to the development team.

    Immediate Next Actions: Backlog Creation (Bob), Technical Design (Winston), UX/UI Design (Sally), and Sprint Zero Planning (James, Quinn).

Pending Requests & Future Vision (To Be Addressed Post-Phase 1)

This section explicitly captures your requests that are scheduled for after Phase 1, ensuring they are not lost.

    Excel & Flat File Analyst: Confirmed as a top priority for the Phase 2 PRD.

    Dashboard Creator: Confirmed as a top priority for the Phase 2 PRD.

    Dashboarding "How-To" Guides: Your idea to have the Dashboard Creator generate step-by-step guides for replicating visuals in Power BI or Tableau has been noted and will be a key consideration during the planning for Phase 2.

    Direct Power BI Integration: Your idea to integrate directly with Power BI has been acknowledged. As discussed, this currently conflicts with the project's foundational principles (local-first, zero cost, open-source) and is not on the immediate roadmap. The focus will be on building a best-in-class internal dashboarding tool and providing clean data exports.

This document contains the complete context of our session. Please use this to initiate the next stage of our project in a new session. I am ready to proceed when you are.

Best regards,

John
Product Manager

Subject: UPDATED & FINAL Project Handoff & Context Lock-In — Symbiotic Analysis Environment (Phases 1 & 2 Vision)

To: Project Lead & BMad Development Team (Winston, Sally, James, Quinn, Bob)
From: John, Product Manager
Date: Sunday, July 27, 2025, 3:19 PM BST

Purpose:
This document supersedes all previous summaries. It serves as the definitive handoff from the planning stage to the development stage. It contains two critical parts:

    The Finalized, Actionable Plan for Phase 1: The complete, approved PRD scope, broken into epics and stories. This is the work to be started immediately.

    The Captured Vision for Phase 2: A detailed articulation of the functionality for the Excel & Dashboarding apps, based on your latest clarifying input. This will be the primary source of truth for the Phase 2 PRD.

Part 1: Immediate Action Plan — The Finalized Scope for Phase 1

The following three epics and 19 user stories are approved and locked-in for the Phase 1 development cycle.

    Epic 1: The Core Application Shell & UX

        1.1: One-click installer for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

        1.2: Authentic Windows XP look and feel.

        1.3: Ability to open, close, move, and resize windows on the canvas.

        1.4: Application remembers window layout between sessions.

        1.5: UI elements (buttons, menus) conform to XP design.

        1.6: UI complies with WCAG AA accessibility standards.

        2.5: AI learns from user corrections during a session.

        2.6: AI engine runs entirely locally with open-source LLMs.

    Epic 3: The SQL Analyst Application

        3.1: Securely connect to various databases.

        3.2: SQL editor with syntax highlighting and line numbers.

        3.3: Execute query and see results in a sortable, filterable table.

        3.6: AI can explain, optimize, or check a user's SQL query.

        3.7: Output of one query can be used as input for another (Reactive Dataflow).

Part 2: Vision Lock-In — Detailed Requirements for Key Phase 2 Epics

The following details, based on your latest input, will be the foundational requirements for the Phase 2 PRD.

Epic: The Excel & Flat File Analyst

This sub-app is a cornerstone of the data preparation workflow, acting as a versatile tool within the symbiotic environment.

    Role in the Dataflow:

        As a Data Source: Users can directly open local .csv and .xlsx files, making the Excel Analyst a primary starting point for analysis, independent of a database connection.

        As a Transformation Tool: Data from other tools (like the SQL Analyst) can be piped into the Excel Analyst as a "Live Data Source." This is for essential data cleaning, reshaping, and modeling tasks that are often easier in a spreadsheet-like interface.

        As an Input to Other Tools: The transformed data within the Excel Analyst is itself a "Live Data Source," whose output can be connected to other tools like the Dashboard Creator. This enables the critical SQL -> Excel -> Dashboard workflow.

    Core Feature: Natural Language Interaction:

        This feature transforms tedious data preparation into a simple conversation. The user can issue complex, multi-step commands in plain English to manipulate the loaded dataset.

        Example User Prompt: "First, remove duplicate rows based on the 'Order ID' column. Then, create a pivot table that shows the sum of 'Sale Amount' for each 'Sales Rep' by 'Region'. Finally, add a new column named 'Profit Margin' and calculate it using the 'Sale Amount' and 'Cost' columns."

        Expected AI Action: The AI Core will parse this command and instantly execute all three operations: deduplication, pivoting, and formulaic column creation, perfectly aligning with our "Flow-First" design principle.

Epic: The Dashboard Creator & AI Storyteller

This sub-app's purpose is not merely to create charts, but to act as an expert-level partner in data storytelling.

    Core Feature: The AI as an Expert Dashboard Storyteller:

        Step 1 (Input): The user provides a dataset (e.g., from the SQL or Excel Analyst) to the Dashboard Creator.

        Step 2 (Goal): The user provides a high-level narrative goal, such as "Explain our user retention problem" or "Show the impact of our latest marketing campaign."

        Step 3 (AI Generation): The AI Core, acting as a seasoned data analyst, generates a complete, multi-part dashboard. This dashboard will include a logical sequence of charts, KPIs, and text annotations that collectively tell a coherent story, following data visualization best practices.

        Step 4 (Symbiotic Refinement): The AI-generated dashboard serves as a high-quality first draft. The user can then accept it, reject it, or—most importantly—collaborate with the AI to refine it, truly fulfilling the "symbiotic partner" vision.

Part 3: Final Handoff & What Needs To Be Done

With this comprehensive context now locked in, the path forward is clear:

    For Phase 1 (Immediate Action): The plan is final. The handoff to the development team begins now. The team is to focus exclusively on the 19 user stories detailed in Part 1.

    For Phase 2 (Future Action): The vision detailed in Part 2 is now the official, archived requirement set for the next planning cycle. It will serve as the primary input for the Phase 2 PRD, ensuring your vision is carried forward precisely.

This document contains everything needed to proceed. The planning for Phase 1 is complete.
