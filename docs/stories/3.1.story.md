# Story 3.1: Securely connect to various databases

## Status
QA Complete - APPROVED

## Story
As a data artisan using the SQL Analyst application,
I want to securely connect to various databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, etc.),
so that I can analyze data from different sources while ensuring my credentials are protected using native OS security mechanisms and never stored in plain text.

## Dev Notes

### Security Requirements (Zeus Directive Integration)
- **CRITICAL**: Database passwords MUST ONLY be stored in native OS Keychain - never in files, memory dumps, or logs
- **CRITICAL**: Implement comprehensive Threat Model testing including unauthorized access attempts and memory scraping attacks
- **CRITICAL**: All credential operations must be handled exclusively by Rust Shell backend - Frontend never touches raw credentials
- **MANDATORY**: Test against credential theft scenarios before QA submission
- Connection strings must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Implement secure memory handling for temporary credential access
- Use secure communication protocols between Frontend and Rust Shell

### Native OS Keychain Integration Details
- **Windows**: Use Windows Credential Manager API (CredWrite, CredRead, CredDelete)
- **macOS**: Use Security Framework with Keychain Services API
- **Linux**: Use libsecret for Secret Service API integration
- Implement proper error handling for keychain access failures
- Handle keychain unlock scenarios gracefully
- Provide fallback mechanisms for keychain unavailability

### Database Support Requirements
- **PostgreSQL**: Support versions 10+, SSL/TLS, connection pooling
- **MySQL**: Support versions 5.7+, SSL/TLS, multiple authentication methods
- **SQLite**: File-based connections, WAL mode support, concurrent access
- **SQL Server**: Windows Authentication, SQL Authentication, SSL/TLS
- **Oracle**: Basic connectivity, TNS support, SSL/TLS
- All connections must support timeout configuration and retry logic

### Technical Architecture
- Rust Shell manages all credential operations and database connections
- Frontend communicates via JSON-RPC for connection management
- Connection abstraction layer provides unified interface across database types
- Connection pooling managed at Rust Shell level for performance
- Secure parameter passing between components

### UI/UX Requirements
- Authentic Windows XP visual styling matching application shell
- Connection list with clear visual status indicators
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Progressive disclosure for advanced connection options
- Consistent error messaging and user guidance

### Performance Targets
- Connection establishment: <5 seconds for local databases, <10 seconds for remote
- Connection testing: <3 seconds with clear progress indication
- UI responsiveness: <100ms for all user interactions
- Memory usage: Minimal credential retention in memory
- Connection pooling: Support for 10+ concurrent connections

### Integration Points
- Rust Shell: Primary credential and connection management
- Frontend: UI for connection management and status display
- JSON-RPC: Secure communication protocol for connection operations
- Application Shell: Integration with main application lifecycle
- Future SQL Editor: Connection selection and management interface
