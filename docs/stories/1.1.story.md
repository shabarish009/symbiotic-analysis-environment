## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** The PO validation report identifies a critical gap - no detailed backend/full-stack architecture document exists yet. This story can proceed based on available frontend architecture, but backend integration details are incomplete.

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous story context available.

### Tech Stack Information
[Source: docs/project-brief.md.txt, docs/prd.md.txt]
- **Primary Framework:** Tauri (Rust backend with web frontend)
- **AI Core:** Embedded Python process for local LLMs
- **Target Platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux (cross-platform desktop application)
- **Architecture:** Local-first, open-source desktop application
- **Frontend:** Modern web frontend (React/Vue/Svelte - specific choice not yet documented)

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/prd.md.txt]
- **NFR2:** Built with Tauri (Rust backend) and a web frontend
- **NFR5:** Must be Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)
- **NFR6:** Zero mandatory cloud service costs
- **Constraint:** Solo-developer, zero-dollar budget project

### Project Structure Notes
**STRUCTURAL CONFLICT IDENTIFIED:** The core-config.yaml expects sharded architecture documentation in `docs/architecture/`, but this directory structure doesn't exist yet. Current project has `.txt` files in docs/ directory instead of the expected sharded structure.

### Installer-Specific Technical Details
[Source: docs/rontend-architecture.md.txt - PO Validation Report]
- **Requirement:** Story 1.1 requires a one-click installer, but specific implementation details are not yet architected
- **Recommendation:** The architecture should specify the chosen technology (e.g., NSIS for Windows, macOS packaging tools) to guide the developer
- **Dependency:** This story depends on having the basic Tauri application structure in place

### File Locations
Based on typical Tauri project structure (architecture docs not yet available):
- Tauri configuration: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- Build scripts: `src-tauri/build.rs` or package.json scripts
- Platform-specific configurations: `src-tauri/` directory
- Output installers: `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`

### Testing Requirements
**No specific testing strategy found in architecture docs** - Testing strategy document not yet available.
- Manual testing required on each target platform
- Automated testing of installer generation process
- Verification of post-installation application functionality

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**ARCHITECTURE GAP:** No testing strategy document available yet. The following are general requirements:
- **Test Approach:** Manual testing on target platforms required
- **Test Environments:** Windows 10/11, macOS (recent versions), major Linux distributions
- **Validation:** Post-installation application launch verification
- **Regression Testing:** Installer functionality across OS updates

- Thorough validation testing framework

**Areas Improved During Review:**
- Enhanced security with proper CSP configuration
- Improved error handling and timeout management
- Better frontend architecture with class-based structure
- Added proper metadata and repository information
- Enhanced build script with command-line argument support

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`
  - **Change**: Added missing `greet` command that frontend was trying to invoke
  - **Why**: Frontend was calling `invoke('greet')` but no corresponding command existed in backend
  - **How**: Implemented proper Tauri command with greeting functionality and registered it in the invoke handler

- **File**: `src-tauri/src/main.rs`
  - **Change**: Fixed library name inconsistency from `app_lib` to `symbiotic_analysis_environment_lib`
  - **Why**: Library name in Cargo.toml didn't match the reference in main.rs
  - **How**: Updated the library reference to match the actual library name defined in Cargo.toml

- **File**: `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
  - **Change**: Enabled Content Security Policy (CSP) with appropriate permissions
  - **Why**: Security best practice - CSP was disabled (null) which poses security risks
  - **How**: Added restrictive CSP allowing self-hosted content with necessary inline styles/scripts

- **File**: `main.js`
  - **Change**: Refactored to class-based architecture with proper error handling
  - **Why**: Original code lacked structure and proper error handling for backend connection
  - **How**: Created SymbioticApp class with initialization, connection testing, and UI feedback methods

- **File**: `build-installers.js`
  - **Change**: Enhanced error handling, added timeouts, and command-line argument support
  - **Why**: Original script lacked robust error handling and testing capabilities
  - **How**: Added timeout handling, better error messages, file operation error handling, and --test flag support

- **File**: `vite.config.js`
  - **Change**: Enhanced configuration with chunk splitting and debug optimizations
  - **Why**: Better build optimization and development experience
  - **How**: Added vendor chunk splitting, console dropping in production, and host specification

- **File**: `package.json`
  - **Change**: Added proper metadata, repository info, and corrected main entry point
  - **Why**: Missing essential package metadata and incorrect main file reference
  - **How**: Added author, license, repository, keywords, and corrected main field to "main.js"

- **File**: `.gitignore` (Created)
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive .gitignore for Node.js and Tauri projects
  - **Why**: Essential for version control hygiene - prevents committing build artifacts and dependencies
  - **How**: Created standard .gitignore covering Node.js, Tauri build outputs, IDE files, and OS artifacts
