## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: FINALIZED FULL-STACK ARCHITECTURE V1.0 - Winston, Architect]

**Current Foundation Available:**
- **WindowFrame Component**: Basic window chrome with move functionality implemented
- **Window State Management**: WindowState interface with position, size, and state properties
- **Desktop Canvas**: Container for window positioning and interaction
- **Session Persistence**: Architecture specifies session.json for UI state persistence

**Required Enhancements:**
- **Resize System**: Complete implementation of resize handles and logic
- **Boundary Management**: Desktop edge detection and window constraints
- **Session Persistence**: File-based window layout storage and restoration
- **Performance Optimization**: Smooth rendering for multiple windows

### UI/UX Specification Context
[Source: FINALIZED UI/UX SPECIFICATION V1.0 - Sally, UX Expert]

**Design Requirements:**
- **Authentic XP Behavior**: Window operations must match Windows XP Luna theme behavior exactly
- **Visual Feedback**: Proper cursor changes, resize handles, and move indicators
- **Accessibility First**: All window operations accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- **Performance Standards**: Smooth 60fps window operations without visual artifacts

### Technical Implementation Details

**Current Window Management State:**
- WindowFrame component has basic move functionality via title bar dragging
- Resize handles are rendered but not functional (onResize prop not implemented)
- Window state includes position, size, minimized/maximized flags
- No session persistence currently implemented
- Z-index management is basic (incremental on focus)

**Required Implementation Areas:**

**1. Resize Functionality:**
```typescript
interface ResizeState {
  isResizing: boolean;
  resizeDirection: 'n' | 's' | 'e' | 'w' | 'ne' | 'nw' | 'se' | 'sw';
  startPosition: { x: number; y: number };
  startSize: { width: number; height: number };
}
```

**2. Session Persistence Structure:**
```typescript
interface SessionData {
  version: string;
  windows: {
    [windowId: string]: {
      position: { x: number; y: number };
      size: { width: number; height: number };
      isMinimized: boolean;
      isMaximized: boolean;
      zIndex: number;
    };
  };
  desktop: {
    icons: DesktopIcon[];
  };
}
```

**3. Window Constraints:**
- Minimum window size: 200x100 pixels
- Maximum window size: Desktop dimensions minus taskbar
- Boundary constraints: At least 50px of title bar must remain visible
- Snap zones: 10px from desktop edges

**4. Performance Considerations:**
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth resize/move operations
- Implement window virtualization for large numbers of windows
- Optimize re-renders using React.memo and useMemo
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations

**Integration Points:**
- Extend existing WindowFrame component with resize handlers
- Enhance App.tsx window management with persistence
- Integrate with Tauri filesystem APIs for session.json
- Maintain compatibility with existing XP theme system

**Critical Implementation Notes:**
- **Resize Handle Implementation**: Must use proper mouse event handling with global listeners
- **Session File Location**: Use Tauri's app data directory for session.json
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if session file is corrupted
- **Performance**: Throttle resize/move events to prevent excessive re-renders
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all operations work with keyboard-only navigation

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: FINALIZED FULL-STACK ARCHITECTURE V1.0]
- **Framework**: Vitest & React Testing Library (mandatory)
- **Coverage Areas**: Window operations, session persistence, accessibility
- **Performance Tests**: Multi-window scenarios and smooth operation validation
- **Integration Tests**: Full window lifecycle from creation to persistence

**Specific Test Cases:**
- Window resize in all directions with boundary constraints
- Session save/load with various window configurations
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Performance under multiple window scenarios
- Error recovery from corrupted session data
