# Story 3.3: Execute query and see results in a sortable, filterable table

**Epic:** 3 - The SQL Analyst Application  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Complete
**Assigned to:** James (Frontend Developer)  
**QA Reviewer:** Quinn (Senior QA Engineer)  

## User Story

As a data analyst, I want to execute SQL queries and see the results in a sortable, filterable table so that I can analyze and explore my data efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Execute button triggers query execution using the active database connection from Story 3.1
- [ ] Query results display in a professional data grid component below the SQL editor
- [ ] Results grid supports sorting by any column (ascending/descending)
- [ ] Results grid supports filtering by column values (text search, numeric ranges)
- [ ] Display query execution time and row count metadata
- [ ] Handle empty result sets gracefully with appropriate messaging

### Performance & User Experience (Zeus Directive Integration)
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Implement non-blocking query execution architecture to prevent UI lag
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Functional "Cancel Query" button that terminates running queries
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Real-time progress updates during query execution
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Performance test with >100,000 row datasets using UI virtualization
- [ ] Query execution status indicators (running, completed, error, cancelled)
- [ ] Responsive design that works on various screen sizes

### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- [ ] Display clear error messages for SQL syntax errors
- [ ] Handle database connection failures gracefully
- [ ] Show appropriate messages for queries that return no results
- [ ] Handle very large result sets without browser crashes
- [ ] Timeout handling for long-running queries (configurable, default 5 minutes)

### Accessibility (WCAG AA Compliance)
- [ ] Screen reader support for table navigation and content
- [ ] Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- [ ] High contrast support for data visibility
- [ ] Focus management during query execution states
- [ ] ARIA live regions for status updates

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- **Technology Stack:** React/TypeScript frontend with TanStack Table for headless table utility
- **Communication:** JSON-RPC protocol with Rust Shell for database operations
- **Component Structure:** ResultsGrid as primary child of SQLAnalystApp alongside SQLEditor
- **Performance:** UI virtualization (windowing) for large datasets

### Component Specifications

#### ResultsGrid Component
```typescript
interface ResultsGridProps {
  queryResults: QueryResult | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  onCancelQuery: () => void;
}

interface QueryResult {
  columns: ColumnDefinition[];
  rows: any[][];
  executionTime: number;
  rowCount: number;
  queryId: string;
}
```

#### Query Execution Flow
1. User clicks Execute button in SQLEditor
2. Frontend sends query via JSON-RPC to Rust Shell
3. Rust Shell executes query against database connection
4. Results stream back with progress updates
5. ResultsGrid renders with virtualization for performance

### Dev Notes (Zeus Directive Implementation)

#### Asynchronous Architecture Requirements
- Implement query execution as a background process with WebWorker or similar
- Use AbortController for query cancellation
- Implement progress streaming via Server-Sent Events or WebSocket
- Ensure UI remains responsive during long-running queries

#### Performance Testing Mandate
- **CRITICAL:** Before QA submission, test with dataset containing >100,000 rows
- Validate UI virtualization performance (target: <100ms scroll response)
- Memory usage must remain stable during large dataset operations
- Implement row height estimation for smooth scrolling

#### Error Handling Strategy
- Distinguish between SQL errors, connection errors, and timeout errors
- Provide actionable error messages with suggestions
- Log detailed error information for debugging
- Graceful degradation for partial result sets

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and tested
- [ ] Query execution works with all supported database types from Story 3.1
- [ ] Results grid handles datasets from 0 to 100,000+ rows smoothly
- [ ] Cancel functionality works reliably during query execution
- [ ] All error scenarios handled with appropriate user feedback

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Performance test with >100,000 rows completed successfully
- [ ] Unit tests for all components with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for query execution flow
- [ ] Accessibility audit passed (WCAG AA compliance)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Code follows established patterns from Stories 3.1 and 3.2
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier formatting applied
- [ ] Documentation updated for new components
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite:** Story 3.1 (Database Connection Manager) - DONE
- **Prerequisite:** Story 3.2 (SQL Editor) - DONE
- **Technology:** TanStack Table library integration
- **Architecture:** JSON-RPC communication protocol established

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Risks
- **Risk:** Large datasets causing browser crashes
- **Mitigation:** Mandatory UI virtualization with row windowing
- **Validation:** >100,000 row performance test before QA

### User Experience Risks
- **Risk:** Long-running queries blocking UI
- **Mitigation:** Asynchronous execution with cancel capability
- **Validation:** Progress updates and responsive cancel button

### Data Integrity Risks
- **Risk:** Partial or corrupted result sets
- **Mitigation:** Checksum validation and error detection
- **Validation:** Integration tests with various data types

## Success Metrics

- Query execution response time: <2 seconds for typical queries (<10,000 rows)
- UI responsiveness: <100ms for all user interactions during query execution
- Large dataset handling: Smooth scrolling with >100,000 rows
- Error recovery: Clear error messages with <5 second display time
- Accessibility: 100% keyboard navigation coverage
