# Story 2.2: Consensus Engine uses multiple models to generate a trustworthy answer

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** data artisan using the SQL Analyst application,
**I want** the AI engine to use multiple models in parallel to cross-validate responses and generate a single, trustworthy answer,
**so that** I can rely on the AI's output with high confidence, knowing that hallucinations and errors have been minimized through consensus validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Consensus Engine manages multiple AI models simultaneously within the Python AI Core
2. Engine sends identical queries to multiple models in parallel for efficiency
3. Response validation logic compares outputs and identifies consensus vs. disagreement
4. Confidence scoring system rates the trustworthiness of the final answer
5. Conflict resolution mechanism handles disagreements between models intelligently
6. Single validated response is returned to the Shell via JSON-RPC
7. Clear error/ambiguity messages are provided when consensus cannot be reached
8. Model isolation prevents any single model from affecting others or the system
9. Timeout and resource management ensures system stability under load
10. Logging captures all model interactions and consensus decisions for debugging
11. Configuration allows adjustment of consensus thresholds and model weights
12. Performance optimization minimizes latency while maintaining accuracy

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: FINALIZED FULL-STACK ARCHITECTURE V1.0 - Winston, Architect]

**AI Core Responsibility:**
- The Python AI Core is responsible for all heavy computation, including running the Consensus Engine
- Must receive a single task from the Rust Shell and return a single, validated result
- Implementation must be secure, preventing any single model from executing malicious code or causing instability

**Inter-Process Communication:**
- Single JSON-RPC request from Shell triggers consensus process
- Single JSON-RPC response with validated result or clear error message
- All complexity hidden within the AI Core implementation

### UI/UX Specification Context
[Source: FINALIZED UI/UX SPECIFICATION V1.0 - Sally, UX Expert]

**Transparent Symbiosis Principle:**
- The Consensus Engine is a core enabler for transparent AI operation
- Engine's output is the "trustworthy answer" that will be displayed to the user
- User should understand the confidence level of the AI's response
- Clear indication when consensus cannot be reached

### Technical Implementation Requirements

**Consensus Engine Architecture:**
```python
class ConsensusEngine:
    def __init__(self, config: ConsensusConfig):
        self.models = []  # List of AI model instances
        self.config = config
        self.validator = ResponseValidator()
        self.scorer = ConfidenceScorer()
        self.resolver = ConflictResolver()
    
    async def process_query(self, query: str) -> ConsensusResult:
        """Process query through multiple models and return consensus"""
        # Parallel model execution
        responses = await self.execute_parallel_queries(query)
        
        # Validate and score responses
        validated_responses = self.validator.validate_responses(responses)
        
        # Generate consensus
        consensus = self.generate_consensus(validated_responses)
        
        return consensus
```

**Model Isolation Framework:**
```python
class ModelExecutor:
    def __init__(self, model_config: ModelConfig):
        self.model = self.load_model(model_config)
        self.sandbox = ModelSandbox()
        self.timeout_manager = TimeoutManager()
    
    async def execute_query(self, query: str, timeout: float) -> ModelResponse:
        """Execute query with isolation and timeout"""
        try:
            with self.sandbox.isolate():
                response = await self.timeout_manager.execute_with_timeout(
                    self.model.generate_response(query),
                    timeout
                )
                return ModelResponse(
                    content=response,
                    model_id=self.model.id,
                    confidence=self.model.confidence,
                    execution_time=self.timeout_manager.elapsed_time
                )
        except Exception as e:
            return ModelResponse.error(str(e), self.model.id)
```

**Response Validation System:**
```python
class ResponseValidator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.similarity_analyzer = SemanticSimilarityAnalyzer()
        self.content_validator = ContentValidator()
    
    def validate_responses(self, responses: List[ModelResponse]) -> List[ValidatedResponse]:
        """Validate and analyze model responses"""
        validated = []
        
        for response in responses:
            # Content validation
            content_score = self.content_validator.validate(response.content)
            
            # Semantic analysis
            similarity_scores = self.similarity_analyzer.compare_with_others(
                response, responses
            )
            
            validated.append(ValidatedResponse(
                response=response,
                content_score=content_score,
                similarity_scores=similarity_scores,
                is_valid=content_score > self.config.min_content_score
            ))
        
        return validated
```

**Consensus Generation Logic:**
```python
class ConsensusGenerator:
    def __init__(self, config: ConsensusConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.conflict_resolver = ConflictResolver()
    
    def generate_consensus(self, validated_responses: List[ValidatedResponse]) -> ConsensusResult:
        """Generate consensus from validated responses"""
        
        # Filter valid responses
        valid_responses = [r for r in validated_responses if r.is_valid]
        
        if len(valid_responses) == 0:
            return ConsensusResult.no_valid_responses()
        
        # Calculate consensus score
        consensus_score = self.calculate_consensus_score(valid_responses)
        
        if consensus_score >= self.config.consensus_threshold:
            # Strong consensus - return best response
            best_response = self.select_best_response(valid_responses)
            return ConsensusResult.consensus(
                response=best_response.content,
                confidence=consensus_score,
                supporting_models=len(valid_responses)
            )
        else:
            # Weak consensus - attempt conflict resolution
            resolved = self.conflict_resolver.resolve_conflicts(valid_responses)
            
            if resolved.success:
                return ConsensusResult.resolved_consensus(
                    response=resolved.content,
                    confidence=resolved.confidence,
                    resolution_method=resolved.method
                )
            else:
                return ConsensusResult.ambiguous(
                    conflicting_responses=[r.content for r in valid_responses],
                    reason="Models disagree and conflict resolution failed"
                )
```

**JSON-RPC Integration:**
```python
class ConsensusHandler:
    def __init__(self, consensus_engine: ConsensusEngine):
        self.engine = consensus_engine
    
    async def handle_consensus_request(self, params: dict) -> dict:
        """Handle JSON-RPC consensus request"""
        try:
            query = params.get('query')
            if not query:
                return self.error_response(-32602, "Missing query parameter")
            
            # Process through consensus engine
            result = await self.engine.process_query(query)
            
            # Format response
            if result.has_consensus:
                return {
                    'success': True,
                    'response': result.response,
                    'confidence': result.confidence,
                    'supporting_models': result.supporting_models,
                    'execution_time': result.execution_time
                }
            else:
                return {
                    'success': False,
                    'error': 'consensus_failed',

                    'suggestions': result.suggestions
                }
        
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Consensus request failed: {e}")
            return self.error_response(-32603, f"Internal error: {str(e)}")
```
