# Story 1.4: Application remembers window layout between sessions

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** frustrated data artisan,
**I want** the application to remember my window layout between sessions,
**so that** I can resume my work exactly where I left off without having to manually reposition and resize windows, maintaining my productivity flow and workspace organization.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Application automatically saves current window layout to session.json when windows are modified
2. All open windows are restored to their exact positions and sizes when application restarts
3. Window z-index (layering order) and active window state are preserved across sessions
4. Minimized and maximized window states are correctly restored on application launch
5. Session data persists reliably and handles basic corruption scenarios gracefully
6. Window layout restoration works seamlessly without user intervention
7. Session save/restore operations do not impact application performance
8. Session data is stored in a simple, readable JSON format as specified in architecture

### UI/UX Specification Context
[Source: FINALIZED UI/UX SPECIFICATION V1.0 - Sally, UX Expert]

**Smart Session Restore Flow:**
- **Core User Flow**: The "Smart Session Restore" flow will restore windows from the previous session
- **Seamless Experience**: Session restoration should happen automatically without user intervention
- **Adaptive Authenticity**: Session restoration maintains XP aesthetic and user expectations

**Design Requirements:**
- **Invisible Operation**: Session save/restore should be transparent to the user
- **Authentic Behavior**: Windows should appear exactly as they were when application closed
- **Performance**: Session operations should not cause noticeable delays or interruptions

### Technical Implementation Details

**Current Session Persistence State:**
- SessionManager service implemented with localStorage backend
- SessionData interface includes windows, desktop icons, and settings
- Auto-save functionality with debouncing to prevent excessive writes
- useSessionPersistence hook for React integration
- Basic error handling for localStorage failures

**Required Implementation Areas:**

**1. Session.json Format Compliance:**
```typescript
interface SessionData {
  version: string;
  timestamp: number;
  windows: {
    [windowId: string]: {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      position: { x: number; y: number };
      size: { width: number; height: number };
      isMinimized: boolean;
      isMaximized: boolean;
      zIndex: number;
    };
  };
  desktop: {
    icons: DesktopIcon[];
  };
  settings: {
    snapToEdges: boolean;
    cascadeOffset: number;
    autoSave: boolean;
  };
}
```

**2. Window State Restoration:**
```typescript
interface WindowRestoreState {
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  size: { width: number; height: number };
  isMinimized: boolean;

  isActive: boolean;
  zIndex: number;
}
```
