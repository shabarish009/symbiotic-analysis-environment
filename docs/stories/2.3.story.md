# Story 2.3: User can see a simplified view of the AI's "thought process"

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** data artisan using the SQL Analyst application,
**I want** to see a simplified view of the AI's "thought process" including which models agreed, confidence scores, and reasoning steps,
**so that** I can understand how the AI reached its conclusions, build trust in the system, and make informed decisions about whether to accept or refine the AI's recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AI Status Window displays real-time consensus process information during query execution
2. Thought process shows which models participated and their individual confidence levels
3. Visual indicators display consensus status (strong consensus, conflict resolution, ambiguous)
4. Confidence score is prominently displayed with clear visual representation
5. Resolution method is shown when conflict resolution was used
6. Model agreement/disagreement patterns are visualized in an intuitive way
7. Execution time and performance metrics are displayed for transparency
8. Thought process information is updated in real-time as consensus progresses
9. Historical thought process data is accessible for previous queries
10. Information is presented in user-friendly language avoiding technical jargon
11. Thought process display can be toggled on/off based on user preference
12. System gracefully handles and displays error states in the thought process

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: FINALIZED FULL-STACK ARCHITECTURE V1.0 - Winston, Architect]

**AI Core Enhancement:**
- The Consensus Engine already produces detailed result objects with confidence scores and resolution methods
- AI Core must be enhanced to stream real-time progress updates during consensus generation
- Thought process data must be serialized and transmitted via JSON-RPC protocol

**Shell Message Brokering:**
- Rust/Tauri Shell acts as message broker forwarding detailed consensus results to Frontend
- Shell must handle real-time streaming of thought process updates
- Caching and management of thought process data for performance

**IPC Protocol Updates:**
- JSON-RPC protocol requires new message types for thought process streaming
- Bidirectional communication needed for real-time updates
- Message compression for large thought process datasets

### UI/UX Specification Context
[Source: FINALIZED UI/UX SPECIFICATION V1.0 - Sally, UX Expert]

**Transparent Symbiosis Implementation:**
- This story directly implements the Transparent Symbiosis principle
- UI must expose AI reasoning to build user trust and understanding
- Information should be presented in accessible, non-technical language

**AI Status Window Integration:**
- Existing AI Status Window is the designated container for thought process display
- Non-intrusive design that doesn't overwhelm the user
- Expandable/collapsible interface for optional detailed view

### Technical Implementation Requirements

```rust
#[tauri::command]
async fn get_thought_process_history(
    state: tauri::State<'_, AppState>
) -> Result<Vec<ThoughtProcessSummary>, String> {
    // Retrieve thought process history from AI Core

}

#[tauri::command]
async fn toggle_thought_process_visibility(
    enabled: bool,
    state: tauri::State<'_, AppState>
) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Update user preference for thought process visibility
    state.user_preferences
        .set_thought_process_enabled(enabled)
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;
